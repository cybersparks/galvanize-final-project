## About My Project
This website is the first website I'd like to boot up and start my day. I'm constatnly overwhelmed with upcoming meetings, projects due, and the normal day to day. This website has three of my favorite things: stocks of my chosing, random generated qoutes of sages past, and fun easter eggs to get the juices in my brain flowing. I also have real time clocks to show me the time across Americas. This helps me visualize how far in the day my collegues are already in, as well as a reminder to schedule a meeting with them during their working hours.
